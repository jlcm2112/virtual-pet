# Week 2 exercise

-The virtual pet Stacy the snake has 3 attributes: hunger, thirst, and temperature. They increment or decrement at a semi-random rate, and she will tell you when she needs things. 
-Stacy can't feed or water herself, but has the ability to heat herself up on her warm rock when very cold. 
-Stacy likes some food more than others.
-Careful: If Stacy's thirst or hunger get too high, she will die. 
-But if she dies, you can always try again (she's virtual after all, so no big deal).
-You can rename Stacy at any time by tpying "rename".
-You can quit at any time by typing "quit".
